## My process

### Built with 

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned 

I learned how to style unordered lists `ul` and ordered lists `ol` and HTML tables `table` with CSS.

Example:

``` css
ul {
  list-style-position: inside;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on building more frontend projects, and learn JavaScript.
